<h3><img src="/ijcai-asea2021/assets/images/kamal.jpg" style="height:50px; border-radius:50%; margin-right:8px;">Prof. Kamalakar Karlapalem, IIIT Hyderabad</h3>
Kamalakar Karlapalem joined IIIT, Hyderabad faculty in December 2000, and heads the Data Science and Analytics Center,
and Agents and Applied Robotics Group. He is an applied computer scientist with broad research interests: from conceptual
modeling, workflow systems to distributed database systems and performance, from core clustering and classification
algorithms in data mining to information extraction from actionable texts, from high dimensional intensive data visualization to
visual query exploration, from multi-agent systems based simulation to multi-robotic solutions, and recently, he started AI for
society. He has graduated eight Ph.D. and over fifty Masters by Research students. He with his students has participated in
various academic challenges, and competitions like RoboCup, TAC SCM, VAST, and CLEF, and have secured top three
positions in them. He is an alumnus of Indian Statistical Institute (M.Stat), IIT, Kharagpur (M.Tech) and Georgia Tech (Ph.D., 1992) and was a faculty member in the computer science department at HKUST (1992-2000), before joining IIIT Hyderabad.

<h3><img src="/ijcai-asea2021/assets/images/knoblock.jpg" style="height:50px; border-radius:50%; margin-right:8px;">Prof. Craig Knoblock, University of Southern California</h3>
Craig Knoblock is Executive Director of the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California (USC),
Research Professor of both Computer Science and Spatial Sciences at USC, Research Director of the Center on Knowledge
Graphs, and Associate Director of the Informatics Program at USC.
He received his Bachelor of Science degree from Syracuse University and his Master's and Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon
University in computer science. His research focuses on techniques for describing, acquiring, and exploiting the semantics of
data. He has worked extensively on source modeling, schema and ontology alignment, entity and record linkage, data cleaning
and normalization, extracting data from the Web, and combining all of these techniques to build knowledge graphs. He has
published more than 300 journal articles, book chapters, and conference papers on these topics and has received 7 best
paper awards on this work. Dr. Knoblock is a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), a Fellow of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), past President and Trustee of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
(IJCAI), and winner of the 2014 Robert S. Engelmore Award.

Mausam is the founding head of School of Artificial Intelligence at IIT Delhi, along with being a Professor of Computer Science
there, and an affiliate faculty member at University of Washington, Seattle. His research explores several threads in artificial
intelligence, including large-scale information extraction over the Web, and neuro-symbolic machine learning. He received his
PhD from University of Washington in 2007 and a B.Tech. from IIT Delhi in 2001. He was recently awarded the AAAI Senior
Member status for his long-term participation in AAAI and distinction in the field of artificial intelligence. He is ranked the 65th
most influential AI scholar for the last decade by ArnetMiner.
