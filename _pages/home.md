<h2>About ASEA</h2>

Semantics has a vital role in an AI system. In building AI systems for real-world applications, semantics are often extracted from the data and managed through knowledge bases. The critical problems are determining what these semantics are, how to extract the relevant semantics, which representation format to use, and applying these semantics to run an AI system. Although there is research in extracting semantics from databases, tables, documents, images, videos, and even multi-modal data, the work has often been conducted in independent research silos without emphasizing the overarching focus on semantics and AI system.  

This one-day virtual workshop's objective is to bring together researchers working on various streams related to semantics to study and develop the broader research area of semantics extraction and analytics and their applications. The program of the workshop will include invited talks, spotlight paper presentations, and lightning poster presentations to showcase research opportunities, novel solutions and systems, success stories, and future directions. We cordially welcome researchers, practitioners, and students from academic and industrial communities who are interested in the topics to participate and/or submit their original work. The topics and submission requirements can be found in [call for papers](/ijcai-asea2021/call_for_papers).
