- Workflows, methodologies, and frameworks for semantics extractions
-	Knowledge representation for semantics
-	Extract data-specific semantics (e.g., text, image, video, etc.)
-	Extract Semantics from multi-modal data
-	Fusion of semantics from multiple data sets
-	Applied Semantics – how extracted semantics enable AI systems to perform?
-	Semantics and Explainability
-	Semantics representations and specifications
-	Semantics and Data Description
-	Semantics from large-scale data sources such as Wikipedia, Web, and Social Networked data
-	Applications in Finance, Legal, Sports, News, research publications, etc.

<h2>Submissions</h2>

All submissions must be original contributions that have not been previously published and that are not currently under review by other conferences or journals. Submissions will be peer reviewed, **double-blinded**. Submissions will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, significance of impact, interest, clarity and relevance. All submissions must follow the [IJCAI-21 formatting guidelines](https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit){:target="_blank"}. 

We invite two types of submissions 
- Long Papers are no longer than seven pages in total: up to six pages for the main content (including figures) and one additional page for references.
- Short Papers are no longer than five pages in total: up to four pages for the main content (including figures) and one additional page for references. Short papers are appropriate for preliminary results, work in progress, applications, etc. 

Authors are required to submit PDF format. Papers that are not properly anonymized or are longer than set limit or with different format will be rejected without review. Accepted papers will be presented as either a talk or a poster, depending on reviewer’s recommendations. At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop.
