<h2 id="keynote">Keynote: Information Surgery</h2>

In recent years, generative neural network models in natural language processing and computer vision have become the frontier for malicious actors to controllably generate misinformation at scale. These realistic-looking AI-generated “fake news” have been shown to easily deceive humans, and it is, thus, critical for us to develop robust verification techniques against machine-generated fake news. Current misinformation detection approaches mainly focus on document-level fake news detection using lexical features and semantic embedding representations. However, fake news is often generated based on manipulating (misusing, exaggerating, or falsifying) only a small part of the true information, namely the knowledge elements (KEs, including entities, relations and events). Moreover, recent news oftentimes makes claims that do not have verified evidence yet, and evaluating the truthfulness of these real-time claims depends more on their consistency with other information conveyed in other data modalities. In this talk I propose to extend research on Information Extraction to evaluate the veracity of news stories and change the consumption of news media around the world. Such a system would extend traditional event extraction to future event prediction, use cross-lingual cross-media information extraction as a basis to analyze media reports from across the world, identify fine-grained falsified information, fix them and prioritize information for analyst review. I will present a new "Information Surgeon" model, which takes full advantage of state-of-the-art multimedia joint knowledge extraction techniques to analyze fine-grained event, entity, and relation elements, as well as whether these extracted knowledge elements align consistently across modalities and background knowledge. We propose a novel probabilistic graphical neural network model to fuse the outputs from these indicators to detect misinformation and make the results highly explainable. A major challenge to performing knowledge element level misinformation detection is the lack of training data. Hence, we additionally propose a novel graph-to-text generation approach to generate noisy training data automatically by knowledge element manipulation. Experiment results show that our approach achieves 92%-95% detection accuracy, 16.8% absolute higher than the state-of-the-art approach.
