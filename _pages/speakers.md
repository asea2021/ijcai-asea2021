    <h5>Keynote: Semantic Scholar - Advanced NLP to Accelerate Scientific Research</h5>
    <p>Semantic Scholar is a 40 person effort at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence that drives a website used by almost 100M people each year. Our mission is to accelerate the progress of scientific research with augmented intelligence - advanced tools that make it easier to find relevant research, digest it quickly, and make connections between different problems and approaches. This talk will survey some of the NLP advances underlying Semantic Scholar, including full-document understanding, fact extraction and checking, identification of emerging scientific concepts, and extreme abstractive summarization.</p>
